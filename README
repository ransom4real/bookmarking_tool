== Simple Bookmarking tool

This is a sample rails application showcasing the functionalities of a bookmarking application
complete with search functionality. Developed using Rails 3.0.1

This app was developed using TDD principles as tests were written before development began and the
entire application is built around test fixtures.

TODO: Provide more test coverage around search functionality as well as SQLi issues
